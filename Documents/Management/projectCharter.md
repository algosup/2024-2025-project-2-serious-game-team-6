## 1. Project Purpose
The purpose of the Forsaken Planet is to create an educational and immersive game that raises awareness about environmental conservation. Players will explore a damaged ecosystem on an alien planet, learning about ecological restoration and the impact of human-like activities on natural environments. By engaging players in ecological challenges and teaching sustainable practices, the project aims to promote real-world awareness and inspire players to make more environmentally conscious decisions.

## 2. Project Objectives
The Forsaken Planet Project aims to achieve the following objectives:

- **Raise Environmental Awareness**: Educate players on ecological principles and the consequences of environmental degradation, using gameplay mechanics that illustrate the impact of their actions on the ecosystem.

- **Engage Players with Restorative Actions**: Design interactive puzzles and missions that challenge players to restore the planet’s ecosystems through non-violent, ecology-based tasks.

- **Promote Sustainable Thinking**: Inspire players to apply the ecological lessons learned in-game to real-world actions by emphasizing the importance of biodiversity, resource management, and pollution control.

- **Deliver an Immersive Experience**: Create a visually appealing and cohesive 2D game world that engages players with atmospheric environments and adaptive AI, offering an engaging and thought-provoking experience.

- **Collect Data on Player Engagement and Awareness**: Gather feedback on players’ understanding and retention of ecological concepts through in-game metrics and post-game surveys, to assess the game’s educational impact.

---

## 3. Scope
This project will focus on developing an educational 2D game centered around environmental restoration and ecological awareness. The game will include multiple interactive zones, a variety of puzzles, and story-driven missions that educate players on sustainability principles.

### In-Scope
- **Game Design and Development**: Create and implement gameplay mechanics focused on environmental restoration, including puzzle-based interactions, adaptive AI, and ecological impact systems.
- **Narrative and Lore Creation**: Develop a compelling storyline, world lore, and characters (such as the scientist guide) to convey educational messages effectively.
- **Graphics and Art**: Design 2D visual assets for different environments, including Pokémon-style exteriors and Rain World-style interiors, to create an immersive atmosphere.
- **Educational Content**: Integrate educational resources and information about ecology and sustainability within gameplay, supported by guided explanations from the scientist character.
- **Playtesting and User Feedback**: Conduct beta testing with diverse users to gather feedback on gameplay experience and educational impact.
- **Final Testing**: Complete final testing of the game with supporting materials to ensure functionality and player engagement.

### Out-of-Scope
- **Mobile or Console Porting**: The game will be developed only for PC during this phase, with no porting to mobile or console platforms planned.
- **In-Depth AI Development**: Advanced adaptive AI capabilities beyond basic responses to player actions will not be included in this phase.
- **Localization**: The initial release will be in English only, with no additional languages or localization efforts planned.
- **Extensive Marketing Campaign**: Promotion will be limited to organic marketing efforts; no large-scale advertising campaigns will be conducted.

## 4. Deliverables
The Forsaken Planet Project will produce the following key deliverables:

1. **Game Prototype**: A functional prototype showcasing core gameplay mechanics, including ecological puzzles, non-combat interactions with flora and fauna, and the impact of player actions on the environment.

2. **Final Game Build**: A polished, complete version of the game with all in-scope features, including the central hub (ship), multiple interactive zones, educational content delivered by the scientist character, and 2D graphics inspired by Pokémon and Rain World aesthetics.

3. **Playtesting and Feedback Report**: A summary of playtesting results, including player engagement metrics and feedback on educational content comprehension, to assess the game's impact and suggest improvements for future iterations.
