# Weekly Report - Week 5  

## Overview  

This week, our team focused on finalizing the test plan and test cases to meet the deadline. Additionally, we made significant progress on hub completion, implemented the first set of dialogs, linked the hub to the first zone, and began searching for and generating sound effects and music to enhance the game’s atmosphere.  

## Accomplishments  

1. **Hub Completion**  
   - All planned interactions have been added, including placeholders for unlinked functionalities, ensuring a comprehensive framework for future expansions.  

2. **Teleporter**  
   - Successfully implemented teleportation mechanics, allowing seamless travel between the ship and Zone 1, and vice versa.  

3. **Dialogs**  
   - Introduced basic dialog interactions with the scientist character to test the functionality and responsiveness of the dialog box system.  

4. **Sound Design**  
   - Initiated the search and AI generation of sound effects and music tracks to build an engaging audio environment.  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Completed and reviewed the test plan and test cases, ensuring all requirements are clearly outlined and ready for execution.  

## Challenges  

1. **Limited Project Sessions**  
   - The lack of project sessions created delays and forced the team to adjust timelines.  

2. **Minor Merging Issue**  
   - A merge oversight caused missing sprites in the pre-production environment, leading to an invisible environment. This issue caused some stress during the customer meeting but was quickly resolved.  

3. **Meeting Tight Deadlines**  
   - The test plan and test cases required last-minute efforts due to earlier underinvestment, leading to a rushed completion within limited time.  

## Plan for Next Week  

1. **Development**  
   - Finalize game development and complete the implementation of key features.  

2. **User Manual**  
   - Finish writing the user manual to meet the deadline.  

3. **Slideshow Creation**  
   - Begin working on the slideshow presentation, originally scheduled for this week but postponed due to time constraints.  

## Team Mood  

**Rating:** 6.2/10  

The team mood reflects a mix of accomplishments and challenges. While significant progress was made on key features, limited project time, tight deadlines, and personal frustrations impacted overall morale. Achievements such as meeting the test case deadline and resolving technical issues were tempered by fatigue and external distractions.  

## Conclusion  

Week 5 was a pivotal week for the project, marked by both **notable progress** and **challenges**. The team demonstrated resilience in addressing last-minute issues, meeting key deadlines, and advancing the game’s development. However, the lack of project sessions and the need to rush certain deliverables highlight areas for improvement in time management and workload distribution. Moving forward, we aim to maintain our momentum while addressing these challenges to enhance both productivity and team morale.
