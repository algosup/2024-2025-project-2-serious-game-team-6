[Acces to the weekly report 1 here](week1.md)

### Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a strong focus on the kick-off and initial planning stages. We engaged with the client to understand their requirements and began to do a market study to understand what can please to players additionaly to proposals we sent to the client.

### Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - The client provided a short description of what product he want, we had to search what kind of game is possible to make and sent few proposal to the client to orientate his thinking.
2. **Planning**
   - We outlined the project's steps and created a comprehensive Gantt Chart to guide our timeline and milestones.
3. **Conduct Risk Evaluation**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain transparency and manage expectations with the client.
4. **Good Brainstorming**
   - The first day the team conducted a meeting to brainstorm about each member ideas, after listing different game styles and lore ideas the team started to make differents proposals to submit to the client. You can find this meeting summary [HERE](../MeetingSummaries/minutesOfMeeting04-11-2024.pdf).

### Challenges

1. **New Team Dynamics**
   - As a newly formed team, with 33% of first-year students, we spent time understanding our roles and responsibilities, requiring substantial initial research.
2. **Learning Godot**
   - The entire team never used Godot before and had to be trained to it before diving in the project.
3. **Mixing learning and Entertaining**
   - Most of us already played game but none of us knew how to make serious game, we had to train ourself into game design especially focus on serious game.  

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Write the project charter**
   - Because we expected having few results throught our market study and a feedback from the client we will be able to start to write the project charter if not finalize it.
2. **Start Functional Specifications**
   - Begin the functional specifications, based on the project charter.
3. **Begin KPI's setup and tasks assignement**
   - With a defined project and validated by the client we should be able to setup our KPI's and continue the tasks assignement.

### Team Mood

Rate: 7.17/10

The team was a bit disappointed to not have any project hours this week forcing everyone to make overtime to keep on tracks, except that the team was happy about the advancement made this week.


### Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. This foundation enhances our confidence in meeting project deadlines and delivering quality results to the client.

## Weekly Report - Week 2
[Detailed File](week2.md)

### Overview

The first half of the week presented challenges in fully understanding the customer’s needs due to initial communication difficulties. Both our team and the customer faced obstacles: we had trouble interpreting their expectations, and they struggled to articulate their vision clearly. However, by midweek, we realigned our focus and successfully defined the game’s objectives, outlined how it will educate players, and began creating puzzles. Additionally, we started gathering real-world statistics to strengthen the game's educational component.

### Accomplishments

1. **Project Charter**
   - Our team conducted a focused meeting to define the game’s style, main storyline, and mechanics. As a result, we drafted the project charter and shared it with the customer for feedback.

2. **Functional Specifications**
   - Building on last week's foundational structure, we made progress in refining the functional specifications. However, delays emerged due to communication challenges, requiring client validation before advancing with detailed definitions. This slowed the process but ensured alignment with the client’s expectations. The specifications are now more cohesive, incorporating feedback and reflecting a clearer vision of the game's purpose, mechanics, and educational objectives.

3. **KPI Setup and Task Assignment**
   - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been established, except for technical ones related to coding steps. These will be finalized early next week.  
   - Tasks have been assigned to ensure progress is monitored effectively.

4. **Puzzle and Minigame Development**
   - A segment of the team concentrated on designing puzzles and minigames. These aim to offer diverse gameplay, keeping players engaged while subtly teaching important lessons.

5. **Gathering Climate Change Data**
   - To ensure the game effectively educates players, we collected extensive climate change data, including real-world statistics and impactful facts. These will help us tailor gameplay to different difficulty levels, making the game accessible to all players.

### Challenges

1. **Communication with the Customer**
   - Misaligned expectations led to delays at the start of the week as we worked to clarify the customer’s vision for the project.

2. **Limited Project Time**
   - No project time this week slowed progress. This resulted in overtime work to stay on track, which could risk team burnout if prolonged.

### Plan for Next Week

1. **Finalize Functional Specifications**
   - Complete and review the functional specifications to meet the deadline.

2. **Begin Technical Specifications**
   - Start drafting technical specifications to provide the software engineering team with clear guidelines.

3. **Implement Basic Game Mechanics**
   - Begin developing straightforward game mechanics such as player movement (up, down, left, right) and hub navigation while more complex features are being defined.

### Team Mood

**Rating:** 5.33/10  

The team's motivation significantly decreased due to communication challenges with the customer and an overwhelming amount of theoretical classes with little to no project work. This lack of practical application contributed to a decline in engagement and focus.

### Conclusion

This week marked significant progress in refining the project scope and laying the groundwork for future development. While communication challenges initially slowed us down, the team displayed resilience by shifting focus to tangible deliverables such as the project charter, puzzle creation, and data gathering. Next week, we aim to build on this momentum while addressing outstanding challenges.


## Weekly Report - Week 3
