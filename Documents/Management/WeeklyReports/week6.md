# Weekly Report - Week 6

## Overview  
This week, our team focused on developing the User Manual and refining the in-game user experience. Key achievements included the addition of a new subzone with hidden lore, the implementation of interactive dialogs, and the integration of immersive sound effects.

## Accomplishments  

1. **User Manual Progress**  
   - Significant progress was made in drafting the User Manual, with an emphasis on clarity and user-friendliness.  

2. **Subzone Implementation**  
   - A new subzone was designed and integrated, adding hidden lore to enrich the game's narrative depth.  

3. **Interactive Elements**  
   - Interactive dialogs were implemented, along with sound effects, to enhance player engagement and immersion.

4. **New Zone**  
   - The second area (Powerplant) was successfully added, further enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Environmental Enhancements**  
   - We began implementing fauna, flora, and a dynamic environment that evolves based on ecological actions taken by the player.

6. **Slideshow Progress**  
   - As planned, half of the slideshow was completed, setting us up to proceed smoothly next week.

## Challenges  

1. **Sound Asset Availability**  
   - The process of sourcing appropriate sound assets took longer than expected, leading to a slight delay in the integration of audio elements.  

2. **Team Absence**  
   - One of our software engineers was absent for several days, resulting in a temporary delay and a redistribution of tasks within the team.

3. **Overloaded QA Team**  
   - Due to the simultaneous deadlines for the code and the User Manual, our QA team was overwhelmed. This led to half of the team stepping in to assist with reviewing large commits.

## Plan for Next Week  

1. **Slideshow Completion**  
   - Complete the creation of the slideshow and rehearse the presentation for the upcoming week.

2. **Post-Mortem**  
   - Conduct a post-mortem of the project to evaluate our progress and identify areas for improvement.

3. **Team Evaluations**  
   - Each team member will complete a peer evaluation to gather feedback on individual contributions, helping us improve collaboration moving forward.
