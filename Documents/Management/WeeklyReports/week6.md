# Weekly Report - Week 6  

## Overview  
This week, our team made significant strides in developing the User Manual and refining the in-game user experience. Notable accomplishments include the integration of a new subzone featuring hidden lore, the implementation of interactive dialogs, and the addition of immersive sound effects to elevate gameplay.

## Accomplishments  

1. **User Manual Development**  
   - Substantial progress was made in drafting the User Manual, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and user-friendliness.

## Challenges  

1. **Sound Asset Sourcing**  
   - Delays in acquiring appropriate sound assets caused minor setbacks in audio integration.  

2. **Team Member Absence**  
   - The temporary absence of a software engineer required task redistribution, which slowed development in some areas.  

3. **QA Team Overload**  
   - Concurrent deadlines for the User Manual and code reviews placed a heavy burden on the QA team. To alleviate the pressure, additional team members assisted with reviewing large commits.

## Plan for Next Week  

1. **Slideshow Completion**  
   - Finalize the slideshow and rehearse the presentation for the following week.  

2. **Post-Mortem Review**  
   - Conduct a project post-mortem to evaluate progress, highlight successes, and identify areas for improvement.  

3. **Peer Evaluations**  
   - Team members will complete peer evaluations to provide feedback on individual contributions and enhance team collaboration.  

## Team Mood  

**Rating:** 8.43/10  

The team's mood this week was unexpectedly positive, boosted by the ample project time available, allowing us to make steady progress toward completing the game ahead of Friday's deadline.  

## Conclusion  

This week marked a period of strong progress and effective collaboration. Despite minor setbacks such as sound asset delays and team member absence, we stayed on track to meet our goals. The addition of new zones and interactive elements significantly enhanced the game experience, while the dynamic environment added a layer of depth to the gameplay. The teamâ€™s positive attitude and adaptability were key to overcoming challenges and maintaining momentum.  

With the upcoming tasks of completing the slideshow, conducting the post-mortem, and finalizing peer evaluations, we are well-prepared to wrap up the project successfully and on schedule.
