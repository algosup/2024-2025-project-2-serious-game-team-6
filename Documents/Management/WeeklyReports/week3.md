# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This week was much more productive due to a massive amount of project sessions allowed us to catch up on delays incurred over the past two weeks. To simplify development, our technical leader opted for a 3D environment with a unique camera placement to maintain the 2D aesthetic of the characters. However, due to technical challenges, we had to transition from Monday.com to ClickUp.com for task management, introducing slight delays that we aim to recover next week.

## Accomplishments

1. **Switch to 3D Environment**  
   - The team successfully transitioned to a 3D environment with a customized camera placement to maintain the 2D aesthetic of the characters. This decision streamlined development and resolved some artistic challenges.

2. **Platform Transition**  
   - Migrated from Monday.com to ClickUp.com for task management due to a Monday.com free plan deletion. While this transition introduced minor delays, it is expected to improve collaboration and workflow in the long run.

3. **Task Catch-Up**  
   - The team addressed delays from the previous weeks by completing several outstanding tasks, ensuring the project timeline remains on track.

4. **Functional Specifations**
   - The functional specifications document has been completed according to it's deadline.

5. **Player and Scientist Sprites**
   - The player and the scientist (NPC) sprites have been created, and their idle animations are also complete.

6. **Maps**
   - Drafts of the maps were created at the beginning of the week to provide clear guidance for the design and development teams. These drafts serve as a foundation for creating detailed, immersive environments that align with the project’s vision.

7. **Development team progress**
   - They successfully created a test environement 3D and added the ability to pickup items on the floor.

## Challenges  

1. **Platform Migration Delays**  
   - The switch from Monday.com to ClickUp.com caused initial confusion and minor disruptions in task execution.  

2. **Maintaining a 2D Look in a 3D Environment**  
   - Adjusting the environment and assets to preserve the desired 2D aesthetic in the new 3D setup required additional iterations and rework.  

3. **Time Constraints**  
   - Managing overlapping tasks from earlier delays created a tight schedule, necessitating overtime work to stay on track.  

## Plan for Next Week  

1. **Finalize Environment Setup**  
   - Complete adjustments to the 3D environment to fully align with the project’s artistic vision.  

2. **Streamline Workflow in ClickUp**  
   - Optimize task structures and team usage within ClickUp to improve productivity.  

3. **Focus on Gameplay Implementation**  
   - Begin implementing key gameplay mechanics, such as player movement and interaction, to build a functional prototype.

## Conclusion

This week marked a significant turning point for the project. The successful transition to a 3D environment and the completion of key deliverables, such as the player and NPC sprites, functional specifications, and map drafts, demonstrated the team's ability to recover from previous delays. Despite challenges like adapting to a new task management platform and maintaining the 2D aesthetic within a 3D space, the team showcased resilience and adaptability.  

With a clear plan for the coming week, including finalizing the environment setup and beginning core gameplay implementation, the project is well-positioned to maintain momentum. Continued focus on optimizing workflows and addressing remaining challenges will ensure the team stays on track to meet upcoming milestones.
