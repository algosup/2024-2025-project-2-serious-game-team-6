# Weekly Report - Week 3

## Overview

This week was significantly more productive, with an intensive schedule of project sessions allowing us to catch up on delays from the past two weeks. To simplify development, our technical leader opted for a 3D environment with a unique camera placement to maintain the characters' 2D aesthetic. However, technical challenges necessitated a transition from Monday.com to ClickUp.com for task management. While this change caused minor delays, we aim to recover next week.

## Accomplishments

1. **Switch to 3D Environment**  
   - The team successfully transitioned to a 3D environment with a customized camera placement to preserve the 2D aesthetic of the characters. This decision streamlined development and resolved several artistic challenges.

2. **Platform Transition**  
   - Migrated from Monday.com to ClickUp.com for task management due to the discontinuation of Monday.com's free plan. While this transition caused minor delays, it is expected to improve collaboration and workflow efficiency in the long run.

3. **Task Catch-Up**  
   - The team addressed previous delays by completing several outstanding tasks, ensuring the project timeline remains on track.

4. **Functional Specifications**  
   - The functional specifications document was completed on time.

5. **Technical Specifications**  
   - Basic information was added to the technical specifications document. While less progress was made than anticipated, we expect to catch up before the deadline.

6. **Test Plan**  
   - The test plan has not yet been started due to a backlog of reviews accumulating since Week 1, caused by the lack of earlier project sessions.

7. **User Manual**  
   - A skeleton for the user manual was created. It will be populated with information from the functional specifications at the beginning of next week.

8. **Player and Scientist Sprites**  
   - The player and scientist (NPC) sprites were created, and their idle animations were completed.

9. **Maps**  
   - Drafts of the maps were created early in the week, providing clear guidance for the design and development teams. These drafts serve as a foundation for creating detailed, immersive environments aligned with the project’s vision.

10. **Development Team Progress**  
    - The team successfully created a 3D test environment and added functionality for picking up items from the floor.

## Challenges  

1. **Platform Migration Delays**  
   - The transition from Monday.com to ClickUp.com caused initial confusion and minor disruptions in task execution.  

2. **Maintaining a 2D Look in a 3D Environment**  
   - Adjusting the environment and assets to preserve the desired 2D aesthetic in the new 3D setup required additional iterations and rework.

4. **Team Member Relocation**  
   - With the functional specification deadline approaching and it being a substantial document, part of the team was reassigned to assist with its completion and review. This caused minor delays in other tasks, which will need to be addressed in the coming weeks.

5. **Time Constraints**  
   - Overlapping tasks from earlier delays created a tight schedule, necessitating overtime to stay on track.  

## Plan for Next Week  

1. **Finalize Environment Setup**  
   - Complete adjustments to the 3D environment to fully align with the project’s artistic vision.  

2. **Streamline Workflow in ClickUp**  
   - Optimize task structures and team workflows within ClickUp to enhance productivity.  

3. **Focus on Gameplay Implementation**  
   - Begin implementing key gameplay mechanics, such as player movement and interaction, to build a functional prototype.

## Conclusion  

This week marked a significant turning point for the project. The successful transition to a 3D environment and the completion of key deliverables—such as the player and NPC sprites, functional specifications, and map drafts—demonstrated the team's ability to recover from prior delays.  

Despite challenges such as adapting to a new task management platform and maintaining the 2D aesthetic in a 3D space, the team showcased resilience and adaptability. With a clear plan for next week—finalizing the environment setup and beginning core gameplay implementation—the project is well-positioned to sustain its momentum. Continued focus on optimizing workflows and addressing remaining challenges will help ensure the team meets upcoming milestones.
