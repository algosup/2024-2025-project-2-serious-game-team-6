# Weekly Report - Week 2

## Overview

The first half of the week presented challenges in fully understanding the customer’s needs due to initial communication difficulties. Both our team and the customer faced obstacles: we had trouble interpreting their expectations, and they struggled to articulate their vision clearly. However, by midweek, we realigned our focus and successfully defined the game’s objectives, outlined how it will educate players, and began creating puzzles. Additionally, we started gathering real-world statistics to strengthen the game's educational component.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Charter**
   - Our team conducted a focused meeting to define the game’s style, main storyline, and mechanics. As a result, we drafted the project charter and shared it with the customer for feedback.

2. **Functional Specifications**
   - Building on last week's foundational structure, we made progress in refining the functional specifications. However, delays emerged due to communication challenges, requiring client validation before advancing with detailed definitions. This slowed the process but ensured alignment with the client’s expectations. The specifications are now more cohesive, incorporating feedback and reflecting a clearer vision of the game's purpose, mechanics, and educational objectives.

3. **KPI Setup and Task Assignment**
   - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been established, except for technical ones related to coding steps. These will be finalized early next week.  
   - Tasks have been assigned to ensure progress is monitored effectively.

4. **Puzzle and Minigame Development**
   - A segment of the team concentrated on designing puzzles and minigames. These aim to offer diverse gameplay, keeping players engaged while subtly teaching important lessons.

5. **Gathering Climate Change Data**
   - To ensure the game effectively educates players, we collected extensive climate change data, including real-world statistics and impactful facts. These will help us tailor gameplay to different difficulty levels, making the game accessible to all players.

## Challenges

1. **Communication with the Customer**
   - Misaligned expectations led to delays at the start of the week as we worked to clarify the customer’s vision for the project.

2. **Limited Project Time**
   - No project time this week slowed progress. This resulted in overtime work to stay on track, which could risk team burnout if prolonged.

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Finalize Functional Specifications**
   - Complete and review the functional specifications to meet the deadline.

2. **Begin Technical Specifications**
   - Start drafting technical specifications to provide the software engineering team with clear guidelines.

3. **Implement Basic Game Mechanics**
   - Begin developing straightforward game mechanics such as player movement (up, down, left, right) and hub navigation while more complex features are being defined.

## Team Mood

**Rating:** 5.33/10  

The team's motivation significantly decreased due to communication challenges with the customer and an overwhelming amount of theoretical classes with little to no project work. This lack of practical application contributed to a decline in engagement and focus.

## Conclusion

This week marked significant progress in refining the project scope and laying the groundwork for future development. While communication challenges initially slowed us down, the team displayed resilience by shifting focus to tangible deliverables such as the project charter, puzzle creation, and data gathering. Next week, we aim to build on this momentum while addressing outstanding challenges.
