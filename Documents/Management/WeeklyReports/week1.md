# Weekly Report - Week 1

## Overview

This week marked the beginning of our project with a strong focus on the kick-off and initial planning stages. We engaged with the client to understand their requirements and began to do a market study to understand what can please to players additionaly to proposals we sent to the client.

## Accomplishments

1. **Project Kick-off**
   - The client provided a short description of what product he want, we had to search what kind of game is possible to make and sent few proposal to the client to orientate his thinking.
2. **Planning**
   - We outlined the project's steps and created a comprehensive Gantt Chart to guide our timeline and milestones.
3. **Conduct Risk Evaluation**
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies to maintain transparency and manage expectations with the client.
4. **Good Brainstorming**
   - The first day the team conducted a meeting to brainstorm about each member ideas, after listing different game styles and lore ideas the team started to make differents proposals to submit to the client. You can find this meeting summary [HERE](../MeetingSummaries/MinutesOfMeeting04-11-2024.pdf).

## Challenges

1. **New Team Dynamics**
   - As a newly formed team, with 33% of first-year students, we spent time understanding our roles and responsibilities, requiring substantial initial research.
2. **Learning Godot**
   - The entire team never used Godot before and had to be trained to it before diving in the project.
3. **Mixing learning and Entertaining**
   - Most of us already played game but none of us knew how to make serious game, we had to train ourself into game design especially focus on serious game.  

## Plan for Next Week

1. **Write the project charter**
   - Because we expected having few results throught our market study and a feedback from the client we will be able to start to write the project charter if not finalize it.
2. **Start Functional Specifications**
   - Begin the functional specifications, based on the project charter.
3. **Begin KPI's setup and tasks assignement**
   - With a defined project and validated by the client we should be able to setup our KPI's and continue the tasks assignement.

## Team Mood

Rate: 7.17/10

The team was a bit disappointed to not have any project hours this week forcing everyone to make overtime to keep on tracks, except that the team was happy about the advancement made this week.


## Conclusion

The project has had a promising start with strong team spirit and effective communication. This foundation enhances our confidence in meeting project deadlines and delivering quality results to the client.
