## I.Introduction

### 1.Purpose-of-the-Test-Plan

The primary aim of this test plan is to define a structured and systematic approach to testing for our serious game **Forsaken Planet**.  
  
It outlines the **testing objectives**, **scope**, and **methodology** to ensure that all features and functionalities are 
**thoroughly verified** against the specified requirements. This document plays a key role in identifying **potential risks**, 
resolving **defects**, and validating the software’s **readiness for deployment**.

Additionally, the test plan supports the broader project goal of delivering a **high-quality**, **secure**, and **user-friendly product**. 
By serving as a **comprehensive guide**, it provides **clear instructions** for the QA team and acts as a **reference** for project managers 
and stakeholders involved in the testing process.

### 2.Scope-of-Testing

#### a.In-Scope:
The scope of testing for **Forsaken Planet** primarily focuses on ensuring the **core gameplay mechanics** function as intended. This includes testing **player movement, interactions**, and completing **objectives**, as well as verifying key features related to the game’s **ecological theme**, such as **resource management** and **pollution mechanics**. Usability testing will ensure that new players can easily understand the game, with attention to **clear instructions** and **intuitive tutorials**. Additionally, **stability testing** will identify crashes or freezes during gameplay and ensure the **save/load functionality** works properly. **Performance testing** will be conducted to assess **frame rates, lag**, and **loading times**, **content testing** will verify that the game’s **ecological elements** and **assets** are presented accurately and function correctly. Lastly, **regression testing** will be conducted to verify that fixes for **critical bugs** do not introduce new issues or break existing gameplay.

#### b.Out-of-Scope:
Certain areas of testing will be **excluded** or minimized due to constraints such as time and resources. **Compatibility testing** will focus exclusively on the **target platform(s)**, such as **PC** or **mobile**, without extending to other devices or operating systems. **Localization testing** will be limited, with only **one language** supported unless additional translations are deemed essential. **Advanced performance optimization**, such as fine-tuning **frame rates** to perfection, will be deferred, with the priority placed on ensuring **basic playability**. Additionally, the scope excludes testing of **non-core features**, such as minor gameplay variations or additional content not critical to the main experience.

#### c.Goal-of-Testing:
The primary goal of testing our serious game is to ensure that the game effectively **educates players about ecology** while providing an **engaging and enjoyable experience**. This involves **verifying the educational validity and clarity of ecological concepts**, assessing the overall **user experience for intuitiveness and enjoyment**, evaluating the game's ability to **engage and motivate players**, testing for **technical issues such as bugs and performance lags**, ensuring **accessibility for all players**, measuring the **effectiveness of learning outcomes**, and collecting **feedback to identify areas for improvement**. By achieving these objectives, the testing process will confirm that **"Forsaken Planet"** is both a fun, engaging game and an effective educational tool for beginners interested in ecology.

## II.Testing-Plan

### 1.Types-of-testing

#### a.Playtesting:
**Playtesting** is a crucial aspect of game development that focuses on evaluating the game from the player's perspective. The primary goals of playtesting include **assessing user experience** to ensure the game is intuitive, enjoyable, and engaging for players. This involves observing how players interact with the game, **identifying any usability issues**, and gathering feedback on the overall gameplay experience. Playtesting also evaluates **game balance** to ensure the difficulty level is appropriate and the game mechanics are fair and balanced, creating a challenging yet rewarding experience. Additionally, playtesting helps in identifying any **technical problems**, such as bugs, crashes, or performance lags, that may affect the player's experience. It is typically conducted with a **diverse group of players** to ensure that the game appeals to its target audience and meets their expectations.

#### b.Functionnal-Testing:
**Functional Testing** is a systematic approach to verifying that the game's features and functionalities work as intended. The primary goals of functional testing include **verifying requirements** to ensure that all specified requirements and features are implemented correctly and function as expected. It involves identifying **defects or issues** in the game's functionality, such as broken features, incorrect behavior, or inconsistencies. Additionally, it validates **performance** by assessing the game's performance, including load times, frame rates, and overall stability, to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted gaming experience. Functional testing is typically conducted by **quality assurance (QA) teams** who follow a structured testing process, including creating test cases, executing tests, and documenting results.
